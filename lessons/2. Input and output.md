# Data output. print() function

print() is a function that prints what is in its parentheses to the screen.
We will talk more about the function later.


```
>>> print(10000)
10000
>>> print(3.43)
2.34
>>> print("Hello, World!")
Hello, World!
```

Any data type can be in brackets.
Also, the amount of data can be any amount.
In print () function you can create string concatenation using ```+``` sign

.

```
>>> print("Hello, " + "Jake")
Hello, Jake
```

```
>>> print("X:", 1)
X: 1
```
in this case the string ```X:``` and the digit ```1``` are concatenated.
The comma (```,```) in this case serves us as a space and allows us to connect elements of different data types.
