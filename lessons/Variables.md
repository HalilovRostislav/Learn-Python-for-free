# Variables

A variable is an area of ​​memory that stores information. Variable names must begin with an alphabetic character or an underscore (_) character.
Also, the name of the variable can contain a number (name1).
In addition, the name of the variable should not be from the name of Python keywords.

[and, as, assert, break, class, continue, def, del, elif, else, except, False, finally, for, from, global, if, import, in, is, lambda, None, nonlocal, not, or, pass, raise, return, True, try, while, with, yield.]


* boolean - boolean True or False
* int - integers (4, -2, 94)
* float - floating point number(4.65, -0.1, 5.1, 1.0)
* str - strings, for example "hello". In Python 3.x, strings represent a set of Unicode characters
* bytes - a sequence of numbers in the range 0-255


A variable is the simplest named data structure in which an intermediate or final result of a program can be stored.
In Python, as in most other languages, the relationship between data and variables is established using the ```=``` sign. This operation is called assignment.
For exemple: ```a = 5```
in this example, the value ```5``` is assigned to the variable ```a```
