# Variables

A variable is an area of ​​memory that stores information. Variable names must begin with an alphabetic character or an underscore (_) character.
Also, the name of the variable can contain a number (name1).
In addition, the name of the variable should not be from the name of Python keywords:

[and, as, assert, break, class, continue, def, del, elif, else, except, False, finally, for, from, global, if, import, in, is, lambda, None, nonlocal, not, or, pass, raise, return, True, try, while, with, yield.]

A variable is the simplest named data structure in which an intermediate or final result of a program can be stored. In Python, as in most other languages, 
the relationship between data and variables is established using the `=` sign. This operation is called an assignment.
For example: `a = 5` in this example, the value `5` is assigned to the variable a.

Basic data types:

* boolean - boolean True or False
```py
bool = True
```
* int - integers (4, -2, 94)
```py
number = 65
```
* float - floating point number (4.65, -0.1, 5.1, 1.0)
```py
float_num = 1.543
```
* str - strings, for example "hello", 'word'.
```py
my_string = "My name is Jake"
```
* bytes - a sequence of numbers in the range 0-255
```py
myu_byte_num = 56
```
There are some more data types, but we will talk about them later...

# What are variables for?
Variables are needed to store data in themselves. Instead of writing 10 multiple times, you can just put it in a variable and reference it in the future.
You can perform math operations on variables (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division ...), concatenate variables, and more.
