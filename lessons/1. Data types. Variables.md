# Data types. Variables

In real life, we perform various actions with the objects around us. We change their properties, endow them with new functions. 
By analogy with this, computer programs also control objects,
only digital ones. Until we get to the level of object-oriented programming, 
we will call such objects data.
Often a computer program must work with numbers and strings.
The addition operation changed the first number by the value of the second,
and multiplication increased one number by the number of times corresponding to the second.
