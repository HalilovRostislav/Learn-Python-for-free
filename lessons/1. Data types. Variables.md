# Data types. Variables

In real life, we perform various actions with the objects around us. We change their properties, endow them with new functions. 
By analogy with this, computer programs also control objects,
only digital ones. Until we get to the level of object-oriented programming, 
we will call such objects data.
Often a computer program must work with numbers and strings.
The addition operation changed the first number by the value of the second,
and multiplication increased one number by the number of times corresponding to the second.
Numbers, in turn, are also different: whole, real, can have a huge value or a long fractional part.

* integers (int type) - positive and negative integers, as well as 0 (for example, 6, 23, -9, 1).
* floating point numbers (float type) - fractional, they are real, numbers (for example, 3.5, 342.4535, -0.432) 
To separate the whole and fractional parts, a dot is used here.
* strings (str type) - a set of characters enclosed in quotation marks (for example, "car", "What's your name?", "Hello!", "6589", "weonui3AD"). quotes in Python can be single or double; a single quoted character is also a single character
