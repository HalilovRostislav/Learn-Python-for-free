# What is Operator?

A simple answer can be given by the expression ```2 + 5 is 7```.
Here 2 and 5 are operands, and the plus sign ```+``` is called an operator.


# Arithmetic operators

* ```+``` (addition) - adds the values of each operator; a + b 
* ```-``` (subtraction) - subtracts the right operand from the left; a - b 
* ```*``` (multiplication) - multiplies values on both sides of the operator; a * b
