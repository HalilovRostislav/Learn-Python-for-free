# What is operator?

A simple answer can be given by the expression ```2 + 5 is 7```.
Here 2 and 5 are operands, and the plus sign ```+``` is called an operator.

# Сomparison operator

We denote comparisons with words (equal, greater than, less than, greater or equal). In programming languages, signs are used.

* ```>``` (greater than)
* ```<``` (less than)
* ```>=``` (greater than or equal)
* ```<=``` (less than or equal)
* ```==``` (equal)
* ```!=``` (not equal)

```
>>> a = 21
>>> b = 9
>>> a + b < 14
False
>>> a / b == 0
False
>>> a <= b + 5
True
>>> a != b
True
>>> a == b
False
```

# Logical operators

* ```and``` expression is true if both components are true.
* ```or``` expression is true if at least one component is true
* ```not``` reverses a boolean value.

```
>>> print((9 > 7) and (2 < 4))  
True
>>> print((8 == 8) or (6 != 6)) 
True
>>> print(not(3 <= 1))       
True

```
