# What is List?

lists are a separate data type that can store a different number of data types.
to create a list, you need to use square brackets (```[]```).
```py
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
you can also use the ```list()``` constructor to create a list.
```py
a = list()
```

To refer to the elements of the list, you need to use their indices. List item indexing starts at 0.
